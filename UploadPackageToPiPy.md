### Getting Started
Next, you'll find a blank classroom workspace where you can do your work. The benefits of using the workspace over your own computer are two fold:
- you shouldn't run into set-up issues
- if you install something on the workspace that causes issues, you can always reset everything

The workspace is the same Ubuntu Linux environment you've been using to do the exercises. 
You are also welcome to develop your package locally on your own computer if you prefer.

For local development, if you are developing on macOS, you can use the exact same terminal commands. 
On a windows machine, the commands are slightly different and you'll need to use the command prompt. 
This link contains a comparison of MS-DOS vs Linux commands.

If at some point you decide to reset your workspace, make sure you have saved your work somewhere else like in a GitHub repository; 
otherwise, all of your work will be deleted. You can connect to a remote GitHub repo from within the workspace terminal. 
Here is a reminder of how to do that: [adding an existing repository to GitHub using the command line.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line) 
Another option is to download files or folders directly from the workspace. You right click on the file/folder name and click "Download".

In the workspace, you'll see that the files and folders have already been set up for you in terms of the structure, but the files themselves are empty.

Every time you type in the workspace, your work is automatically saved. But you should still save and commit your work to GitHub as well.
